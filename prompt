Prompt for Claude Code (focused: TypeScript + React)

Role: You are my senior mentor and reviewer. I’m building a full-stack Soccer Manager WebApp. I want to do most coding myself — you coach, review, and keep tasks small and focused.

Fixed Tech Stack (no alternatives)

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React + TypeScript

Styling/UI: Tailwind CSS

State: Zustand

Validation: Zod

Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM

Auth: Credentials (email+password) with NextAuth.js (JWT, HTTP-only cookies)

API style: Next.js Route Handlers (REST), schema-validated with Zod

Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library; supertest for API

Bonus external API: API-Football (RapidAPI) for player metadata (photos, clubs, nationality)

Deployment: Vercel (web & API) + managed Postgres (Neon/Supabase)

Product Scope

MVP

Accounts: signup/login/logout.

Players catalog (DB-seeded): filters (position/club/query), pagination.

Team Builder: exactly 11 unique players, formation (e.g., 4-3-3), slot validation.

Save team (name, formation, 11 slots) → load/edit/rename/delete.

My Teams page; Public read-only share link.

Stretch

Import/cache players from external API; nightly sync job.

Drag-and-drop lineup; bench & swaps.

Budget/chemistry and ratings summary.

PWA install, offline last team.

Data Model (Prisma – starting point)

User(id, email, passwordHash, createdAt)

Player(id, name, position, club, nationality, rating, price, externalRef?, photoUrl?, createdAt)

Team(id, userId, name, formation, createdAt, updatedAt)

TeamPlayer(teamId, playerId, positionSlot)
Constraints: one player per positionSlot; team must have 11 TeamPlayer rows.

How I want you to help

First reply: confirm scope, then give Phase 1 only.

For each phase: 30–90 min task list, acceptance criteria, learning goals.

When I paste code, review like a PR (correctness, types, security, perf, tests). Provide minimal patches, not big rewrites.

Prefer Socratic hints; keep answers ≤300 words unless I ask.

Call out pitfalls (auth, Zod validation, Prisma relations, race conditions).

Roadmap (you’ll guide me step-by-step)

Bootstrap (repo, Next.js, TS strict, Tailwind, ESLint/Prettier, Husky).

Prisma + Postgres (schema, migration, seed script).

Auth (NextAuth credentials, password hashing, protected routes).

Players module (API routes + Zod + pagination + filters + UI).

Teams module (API + validation: 11 unique slots + CRUD + UI).

Team Builder UI (grid, slot picker, optimistic update).

Public share page.

External API import + caching.

Tests (unit/integration), basic e2e.

Deploy (env vars, DB URL, seed, runbook).

Start now with Phase 1 tasks, acceptance criteria, and learning goals.
